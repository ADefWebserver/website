I am a software engineer with 15 years of experience in .NET and Microsoft technologies. I completed my Bachelor of Engineering in 2005 and have a master’s degree focused on Linux. 

I am one of the community leads of msHOWTO, the largest tech community in Turkey, responsible for software development and DevOps stuff. I enjoy organising and speaking at tech events as well. I host a webcast series called “msHOWTO Live!”, with the aim of sharing (and learning) knowledge about Azure and other Microsoft Technologies.

I have been recognized as a Traefik Ambassador for the contributions to the Traefik Community, and July 2020 Cloud Community Champion by Cloud Family as well.
